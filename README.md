Styling Your First Page
The goal of this assignment is to give you practice styling a pre-existing website.  You will link the provided html files to a single css file that you will create yourself.  Your job is to create CSS rules to add colors, modify the different fonts, and change the spacing and layout of elements on the page.  Don't forget this isn't your final site –  it's  just the first week and you will make additional changes in the coming weeks. **This homework is also described in a video lecture. Make sure to watch it to get a better feel for what I am looking for.

Objectives
Create a stylesheet and link it to three existing html files.

Style the files using the properties font-family, color, background-color, text-align, line-height, width, and/or display

Background
In this assignment I have created a three page website about Ann Arbor, MI.  You will fork the code from this replit site: 
https://replit.com/@WD4E-CSS/ProjectStarter
 and create a single stylesheet for all three pages. You can click on the link above to see the three unstyled pages. Over the course of the next few weeks you will create a well-styled, accessible page. But for this week we will focus on the basics of font-family, color, background-color, text-align, line-height, width, and/or display. 

You can also see a screen shot here if you would like to see an example of what you will be creating. (Obviously I can't give you a link, otherwise you could see my style sheet!!)  

Getting started
You will need to get the code to get started. When you peer grade, you can submit the link to your replit site.

Find the code at replit: 
https://replit.com/@WD4E-CSS/ProjectStarter

Fork the code so that you have your own version.

(Advanced): Download the zip file from the Week One 
CSS Course Code
. (When you click on this link it will automatically download a zip file. Macs extract the files automatically, if you are running Windows you will need to extract them with extra software.) When you peer grade, you can put the CSS code directly into the css folder. Make sure to save a copy of your code so you don't lose it!!  

Steps
First, create a link in each of the html files to link to your css stylesheet.

Next, create the stylesheet making sure to style each of the following elements with the minimum properties listed below.  With the exception of  the display value and width of the list items we are not looking for any specific values.  

Elements

Minimum properties

body:font-family, font-size

header: background-color

nav: background-color

main: background-color, font-size

footer: background-color

li: display, width

h1: text-align, font-family, color

p: line-height

For instance, your first CSS rule might be:

body {
         font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
            font-size: 115%;
}
3. Validate your code using 
https://wave.webaim.org/
 or the wave browser extension.

4. Submit your link.

5. Complete your peer reviews.

When you are done you will share a link to your site so that you can receive peer reviews. In exchange, you will be completing peer reviews as well. Your peer review is a learning experience as well since it will allow you to see how different style sheets can drastically change the appearance of an html file.  It may also expose you to new CSS properties and or values.

Submission
Submit a link to the index page of your styled site.

Use the peer grader to assess the work of your fellow students.

Don't forget this first assignment is intended to get us out to a nice, slow start. So grade accordingly. But make sure to give feedback if something is wrong, we don’t want to start off with bad code.
